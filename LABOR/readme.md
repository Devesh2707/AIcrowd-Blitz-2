***
### Problem Statement
You will be given information describing various conditions surrounding a given labor group, predict whether the conditions are good or not.

### Dataset
This database contains information about working class or labor class.The databse has information which describes the factors that affect the living conditions of a worker. The attrbutes include the wage increase after first year, second and third year, working hours , pension plan e.t.c. They all have been explained in detail [here](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/aicrowd/practice-challenges/aicrowd_LABOR_challenge/blob/master/Info_dataset.md).

For simplification, attributes have been stored in the CSV file which has 17 columns, the last column is the class of the labor.

### Files:
* train.csv - (31997 samples) This csv file contains the the feature representation of the factors that affect the living conditions of the workers along with the binary value denoting the class the worker belongs to.
* test.csv - (8000 samples) File that will be used for testing. Unlike the training file it contains only the feature representation and not the class. This csv will be used for actual evaluation for the leaderboard score but does not have the binary value denoting the class the worker belongs to.

### Evaluation Metric
During evaluation **F1 score** will be used to test the efficiency of the model.

### Result:
#### No. of Registered: 359
#### Rank: 11
